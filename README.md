## üéõÔ∏è Handlers

Handlers in this project are responsible for processing specific actions related to instances and sockets. They are located in the `src/handlers` directory.

### Instance Handlers

Instance handlers are located in `src/handlers/instance`. They include:

- [`deleteInstance`](src/handlers/instance/deleteInstance.ts): This handler is responsible for deleting an instance.
- [`startInstance`](src/handlers/instance/startInstance.ts): This handler is responsible for starting an instance.
- [`stopInstance`](src/handlers/instance/stopInstance.ts): This handler is responsible for stopping an instance.

### Socket Handlers

Socket handlers are located in `src/handlers/socket`. They include:

- [`control`](src/handlers/socket/control.ts): This handler is responsible for sending control commands to the socket. It includes `startSocket` and `stopSocket` functions.
- [`emergencyStop`](src/handlers/socket/emergencyStop.ts): This handler is responsible for performing an emergency stop on the socket.
- [`manualStop`](src/handlers/socket/manualStop.ts): This handler is responsible for performing a manual stop on the socket.
- [`powerMonitor`](src/handlers/socket/powerMonitor.ts): This handler is responsible for monitoring the power usage of the socket.

Each handler interacts with the [`store`](src/store.ts) to get or update the data of instances and sockets.

## üìö Data Store

The application uses a simple in-memory data store to keep track of instances and server data. The data store is defined in the [store.ts](src/store.ts) file.

### Instance Data

The application keeps track of instances data in the `instancesData` object in the [store.ts](src/store.ts) file. Each instance is represented by an `InstanceData` object, which contains the following fields:

| Field                  | Type                                   | Description                                                                                                                               |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`                   | string                                 | The ID of the instance.                                                                                                                   |
| `energy`               | [InstanceDataEnergy](src/store.ts#L10) | The energy object queried from the device at the start of the instance.                                                                   |
| `amperagePerSecond`    | number[]                               | Amperage report per interval.                                                                                                             |
| `emergencyStopTimeout` | number                                 | The time in milliseconds after which the device will be stopped if it is not stopped manually.                                            |
| `startTimestamp`       | Date                                   | Timestamp when the instance was started.                                                                                                  |
| `stopTimestamp`        | Date                                   | Timestamp when the instance was stopped. Might be `null` if the instance is still running.                                                |
| `powerOnTimestamp`     | Date                                   | Timestamp when the socket was powered on.                                                                                                 |
| `powerOffTimestamp`    | Date                                   | Timestamp when the socket was powered off. Might be `null` if the socket is still handling other instances yet this instance has stopped. |
| `isEmergencyStopped`   | boolean                                | Flag indicating if the instance was stopped due to an emergency stop.                                                                     |
| `isManuallyStopped`    | boolean                                | Flag indicating if the instance was stopped manually.                                                                                     |

### Server Data

The application also maintains a `serverData` object in the [store.ts](src/store.ts) file. This object contains data related to the server and its interactions with instances and sockets. Here are the fields in the `serverData` object:

| Field                                  | Type          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `runningInstances`                     | string[]      | An array of instance IDs that are currently running.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `instancesStopping`                    | string[]      | An array of instance IDs that are currently triggering a power off command.                                                                                                                                                          |
| `latestEmergencyStopTimeoutInstanceId` | string        | The ID of the instance that last triggered an emergency stop timeout.                                                                                                                                                                |
| `powerStatus`                          | PowerStatus[] | An array of `PowerStatus` objects representing the power status of the server. Each `PowerStatus` object contains a `powerOn` field and a `powerOff` field, each of which is an object containing an `instanceId` and a `timestamp`. |

The `serverData` object is updated by various handlers in the `src/handlers` directory. For example, the [`startInstance`](src/handlers/instance/startInstance.ts) handler adds the started instance's ID to the `runningInstances` array, and the [`stopInstance`](src/handlers/instance/stopInstance.ts) handler removes the stopped instance's ID from the `runningInstances` array and adds it to the `instancesStopping` array.
